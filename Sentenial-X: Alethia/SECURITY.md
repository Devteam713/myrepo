# Security Considerations

## Assumptions
- Breach is inevitable
- Exfiltration occurs
- Adversaries may use AI-assisted reconstruction

## Guarantees
- Semantic survivability after exfiltration
- Authorized users retain operational utility
- Semantic cost asymmetry: adversaries pay exponential cost

## Limitations
- Does not replace encryption or access control
- Cannot prevent insider misuse
- Semantic protection is runtime-dependent
