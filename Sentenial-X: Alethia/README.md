# Sentenial-X Alethia Protocol

Alethia is a post-exfiltration semantic security primitive.
It preserves confidentiality by degrading *meaning*, not access.

Alethia integrates with Sentenial-X as a Semantic Control Plane.
Stolen data remains syntactically valid but semantically unstable.

This repository contains:
- Core semantic execution engine
- Trust and entropy modeling
- Sentenial-X integration points
- Experimental attack simulations
