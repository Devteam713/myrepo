# Sentenial-X Alethia Protocol

Alethia is a post-exfiltration semantic security primitive.  
It preserves confidentiality by degrading meaning instead of restricting access.

## Features
- Semantic Execution State (SES) as the atomic artifact
- Adaptive linguistic entropy based on trust signals
- Integration with Sentenial-X for runtime rendering
- AI reconstruction resistant

## Usage
See `/sdk/python/alethia_sdk.py` for integration examples.

## Repository Structure
- `core/` — Semantic, trust, linguistics, orchestration modules
- `agents/` — Local agent and export guard
- `experiments/` — Simulations for testing semantic survivability
- `sdk/` — Python SDK and API specification
- `tests/` — Unit and integration tests
