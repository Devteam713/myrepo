# Threat Model

### Adversary Capabilities
- Steal full datasets
- Access decrypted content via compromised services
- Apply AI-assisted reconstruction

### Adversary Constraints
- No persistent access to trust vectors
- Cannot manipulate runtime semantic engine
- Cannot bypass entropy policies

### Defender Assumptions
- Breach is assumed
- Runtime context and trust are controlled
- Semantic dependencies can rotate or expire
